//! Historical fee hurdles from windows that looked like now.
//!
//! Each block with a hurdle (its vsize-weighted p10 feerate) is one
//! observation; blocks without one (coinbase-only, or every tx below min
//! relay) are skipped, so a window of N is N blocks that carried
//! transactions. For target N, the pair at position `t` is the median hurdle
//! of the [`analog_lookback`] blocks before `t` and the lowest hurdle of the N
//! blocks from `t` (a tx at that rate would have beaten some block's p10).
//! An estimate keeps pairs whose lookback median is within [`ANALOG_BAND`]
//! of the current lookback median, or the [`ANALOG_MIN_NEIGHBORS`] nearest,
//! and takes the requested quantile of their outcomes. Windows that started
//! inside a spike stop steering calm-market estimates, and the reverse.
